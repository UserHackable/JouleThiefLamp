## Steam Punk Joule Thief Flashlight Project

This is another one of my Cache Makers 4H projects. 

We used a ferrite core to wind a small transformer, an LED, a 2N3904 Transistor and a resistor to make a tiny boost circuit regulated only by the knee voltage of the LED. 

I designed the circuit board to be snapped in half, and sandwich the transformer. The whole thing was then put into a 1/2 inch copper pipe union, with a couple inches of copper pipe and a cap for a case.
